        "Portfolio selection is one of the most studied problems in applied optimization, lying at the intersection of finance, mathematics, and computer science. The central question is deceptively simple: *how should an investor allocate capital among a set of available assets to achieve desirable trade-offs between return and risk?*\n",
        "\n",
        "The origins of the field can be traced back to the seminal work of Harry Markowitz (1952), who introduced the mean-variance framework. In his model, the expected return of a portfolio is maximized for a given level of risk, or equivalently, risk is minimized for a target return. This formulation not only established modern portfolio theory but also gave rise to optimization problems involving quadratic objectives and linear constraints. Since then, portfolio optimization has become a benchmark application for optimization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, a portfolio selection problem involves a well-known set of financial assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, funds), relevant estimates associated to those financial assets (e.g., expected returns, covariances, etc.), and constraints that reflect investment policies, such as budget balance (weights sum to one), cardinality limits (only a fixed number of assets can be chosen), or upper and lower bounds on positions.\n",

        "In this particular project we are going to solve a particular instance of portfolio selection problem types. Let us assume that $A=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ is a set of assets on which we can invest part of our funds. Each asset $i$ has an expected return $r_i$ that has been calculated based on the past performance of the asset. A typical strategy in investing consists of maximizing the diversity of the investments. For instance, investing in different sectors. This way, if one sector does not perform as expected not all of the investments are compromised. Based on market studies, we have an estimate of how different two assets $i$ and $j$ are in nature: $d_{i,j}$, with $0\\leq d_{i,j} \\leq 1$ and $0$ meaning that both assets are equal in nature and $1$ meaning that both investments are total opposites. Another diversification strategy applied by investors may consist of investing in $k$ different assets. Given this, we can formalize our investment problem as follows:\n",

Diversity is measured by looking at all pairs of selected assets: if two assets are very different, assigning weights to both contributes strongly to the objective; if they are similar, their joint contribution is small. In this way, the model encourages spreading investments across assets that behave differently rather than concentrating on similar ones.\n",

        "To make the optimization realistic, several constraints are imposed. First, the investor must hold exactly a fixed number of assets, so the model cannot simply spread the budget across every possible option. Second, the full budget must be invested, which prevents leaving money unused. Third, the portfolio must achieve at least a minimum required expected return, ensuring that the solution is not only diverse but also financially attractive. Finally, linking constraints ensure consistency between the binary and continuous variables: an asset can only receive a weight if it has been selected, and if it is selected, its weight must stay within feasible limits.\n",

        "* **What Python version will be employed in the tournament?** 3.10\n",
        "* **Can my metaheuristic use external libraries or packages?** Only those packages that are available by default on Python (no pip install required. https://docs.python.org/3/library/), Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit.\n",
        "* **Can my metaheuristic use multithread programming?** No, all the algorithm should be executed in a single thread and the execution should be sequential. That is, no parallelism is allowed.\n",
        "* **Can my metaheuristic use all the RAM memory that I want?** No, a maximum of 2GB of RAM is allowed for the execution of the genetic algorithm.\n",
        "* **Can my metaheuristic reuse or store information between executions of the metaheuristic?** No, all runs should start from scratch with no information from previous runs.\n",

        "* Detailed description of the design of the submitted metaheuristic. All the operators and phases should be described and examples/traces provided. Pseudo-code should be included and explained for relevant algorithms. Figures can help the understanding of concepts and algorithms.\n",
        "* Experiments: First you should describe what the objective of the experiments is, and after that describe the set of experiments designed: configurations tested, replications carried out, and comparison strategy. The results shall be reported with appropriate tables and/or graphs.  The conclusions of the experiments shall be supported by statistical significance tests.\n",
